Concentration 

How the game works:

There is a game board with twelve playing cards arranged randomly in a grid face down.
The playing cards consist of six matching pairs. 
During each turn:
- a player flips one card over to reveal it's number/ deck;
- the player then turns over a second card , trying to find the matching card in the grid;
- if the cards match, both cards stay flipped over;
-if the cards do not match, then both cards flip back to their initial hidden state;
- the game will display 'wrong' message until the next click.
The game will have a 1 minute countdown timer from the point of the first click and the game will end either when all cards have been matched or when the timer ends.
If all pairs are matched before the time runs out, there will be a congratulatory message.
